 # SuperCommander_1.0

## Commander_Excel_1.0 is a project by Harry G. Dulaney.


### Project Elements:

##### 1) Source (i.e.) choose from new workbook created, retrieve existing Excel workbook to operate on and designate a 
##### web URL to scrape.
##### 2) User can define multiple sources and outputs to create repeatable functions called SuperCommmands. 
##### 3) Saved projects marshall to .xml, creating a highly detailed description of the project and the users supercommands. 
##### 4) I built a JS Nashorn object which I would like to use to access Microsoftâ€™s extensive body exsisting api's for interacting with ##### MS Excel.
