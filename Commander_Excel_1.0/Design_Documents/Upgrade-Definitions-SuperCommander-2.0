	- To do -
	 	-> Create a SpreadSheet object to represent the instance of the users spreadsheet
	 				-> Attributes include:  - filepath (location)
	 										- name 
	 										- database stored id number
	 										
	 	-> HyperSQL to replace xml filesystem.
	 	-> Java has a predefined class called "Task" which takes a generic object. 
	 				- Create a "SpreadSheetTask" Object that extends "Task" and takes a 
	 				SpreadSheet object as its parameter. The spreadsheet task can hold all the options
	 				for methods the user can pick from to perform on their spreadsheet object, which we can define using FILLO. 
	 	-> Consolidate the already written methods into this new application format. 
	 	-> Long term plan is to incorporate batch processing (SPRING @EnableBatchProcessing) 
	 	    and a java.lang.process custom object to handle the "Tasks" as described above.
