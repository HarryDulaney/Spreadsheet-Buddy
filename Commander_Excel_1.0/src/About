Commander_Excel_1.0 is a project designed and coded by Harry Dulaney. 

The purpose of the program is to implement Apache POI and other open source Excel communicator API's
in a way that will award the user with new possibilities for task automation between their computer and MS_Excel. 

The user will create a new project, and name it and save it in the file directory.

Then they will be able to browse a list of commands which they can pick from to interact with existing or new .xlsx
workbooks.

Essentially, the user will create a script themselves using the UI menu to choose the options they want their 
Commander project to run. 

The main elements of a Commander project will be :

1) Source (ie) choose from new workbook created, retrieve existing Excel workbook to operate on, and designate a 
web URL to scrape for 

user designated information.

2) Do something with the source material, (ie) organize it, sort it, or format its style or combine 
with other information. Or perform some 
function on the worksheet data.

3) Select form of output to what workbook or sheet. 

4) Save the task and all its dependencies information, so it can be recalled at the project owners discretion

Amendments:

As the project has developed, and as I have become aware of existing APIs for interacting with .xlsx and .csv files; I have 
become more ambitious with the functional possibilities of SuperCommander Excel.
Specifically, the major upgrades come from integration of two major technologies:

1. Fillo - for advanced manipulation of spreadsheets

2. Nashorn - Java scripting engine for processing JavaScript and other scripting languages.
	-Because Microsoft itself has published extensive API tools for MS Office products, which we can take
	full advantage of using JavaScript.
